# Workload Identity Federation for GitHub Actions -- no service account
# key ever exists for this project. A GitHub Actions job requests a
# short-lived OIDC token from GitHub, exchanges it for a Google access
# token bound to `deploy`, and that exchange only succeeds for a token
# whose `repository` claim matches var.github_repository exactly (so
# neither another repo nor a fork of this one can authenticate as this
# environment's deploy identity).
